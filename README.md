GPA Project â€“ Academic Performance Analysis

This project analyzes academic performance trends using the Academic Performance of University Students dataset (Kaggle, Krishnansh Verma), which contains GPA records for approximately 3,000 undergraduates across four academic years. The goal is to track GPA evolution over time, identify predictors of final GPA from early academic indicators such as first-year GPA and secondary school GPA, and compare programs to see how grading norms and rigor influence performance.

The analysis was conducted in R, beginning with data cleaning and exploration, followed by visualizations of GPA trends by year and program. Regression models were used to quantify the effect of early GPA and program choice on final GPA, with attention to both descriptive patterns and predictive accuracy. Results indicate that first-year GPA is a strong predictor of final cumulative GPA, while secondary school GPA is more useful for forecasting early college performance than long-term outcomes. Program-level differences suggest that grading culture and academic rigor both play a role in shaping GPA distributions.
